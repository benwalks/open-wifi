# CQU & auDA Open WiFi Project

Central Queensland University and the auDA have partnered together to create the Open WiFi project to allow every member of the community open and free access to free WiFi.

This project creates a cross-platform mobile application that automatically identifies open wifi points and stores them on our server for use by other users. Android users can also determine wifi points that are available and in range for the users to connect to.

## Latest changes warning(!)

The most recent version of this project required a complete ground-up project restart and has only been created
with Android in mind.
